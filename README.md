a supply chain management project in PL/SQL

This is a project that I developed with three members in the files and database courses. We modeled a supply chain management working flow
using Oracle as the database platform. The languages we used are SQL and PL/SQL. 
Phase 1 folder is the detailed description about supply chain management, phase 2 folder is our database design plan and initial source codes.
The last phase is shown in the "final procedures and triggers.doc" document, where all the source codes are indicated. 
This project involves advanced SQL development such as triggers, stored procedures, views, and general database design principles.
